My work on UCSD CSE 258 Web Mining and Recommender Systems

## Homework 1 [Regression and Classification Tasks](https://github.com/yrbszhsh/Web-Mining-and-Recommender-Systems/blob/master/Regression%20and%20Classification%20Tasks.ipynb)

Analyzed data from [50,000 beer reviews](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/cse258/data/beer/beer_50000.json). Then trained a simple predictor with a single binary feature indicating whether a beer is an `American IPA', Evaluate result using MSE.

## Homework 1 [Classifier Evaluation and Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/yrbszhsh/Web-Mining-and-Recommender-Systems/blob/master/2.%20Classifier%20Evaluation%20and%20Dimensionality%20Reduction.ipynb)

Implemented weighted 2-class logistic regression by gradient ascent to solve the issue of class imbalance (i.e., an uneven number of the datapoints have a positive label). Then applied PCA dimensionality reduction to try to find the principal components of the word features.
